## HOW THE WEB WORKS

#### Q1. What is a web browser? [U]

- [ ] A program that can display a web page
- [ ] A program used to view html documents
- [x] Both
- [ ] None

#### Q2. Which of the following statements are true? [U]

- [ ] HTTP runs over TCP
- [ ] HTTP allows information to be stored in a URL
- [ ] HTTP can be used to test the validity of a hypertext link
- [x] All
- [ ] None

**Explanation:**
All of the given statements are true. HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) runs over TCP (Transmission Control Protocol), which provides reliable communication between the client and the server. HTTP allows information to be stored in a URL (Uniform Resource Locator) through query parameters or path segments. Additionally, HTTP can be used to test the validity of a hypertext link by sending a request to the link and checking the response status code.

#### Q3. A web cookie is a small piece of data [U]

- [x] Sent from a website and stored in user’s web browser while a user is browsing a website
- [ ] Sent from user and stored in the server while a user is browsing a website
- [ ] Sent from root server to all servers
- [ ] All

**Explanation:**
A web cookie is a small piece of data that is sent from a website and stored in the user's web browser while the user is browsing the website. This allows the website to remember information about the user, such as their preferences or login information, and provide a personalized browsing experience.

#### Q4. URL stands for? [R]

- [ ] Unique reference label
- [ ] Uniform reference label
- [x] Uniform resource locator
- [ ] Unique resource locator

**Explanation:**
A URL stands for Uniform Resource Locator. It is a standardized way to address and locate resources on the internet. It consists of various components such as the protocol (http, https, ftp), the domain name (www.example.com), and the specific path to the resource. The term "uniform" implies that the format and structure of the URL are consistent and universally recognized. The term "resource" refers to any digital content, such as web pages, images, or files, that can be accessed through the internet. Therefore, the correct answer is uniform resource locator.

#### Q5. Dynamic web page: [R]

- [ ] Is same every time whenever it displays
- [x] Generates on demand by a program or a request from browser
- [ ] Both
- [ ] None

**Explanation:**
A dynamic web page is a web page that is generated on demand by a program or a request from a browser. Unlike static web pages, which remain the same every time they are displayed, dynamic web pages can change and adapt based on various factors such as user input, database queries, or real-time data. This allows for more interactive and personalized web experiences.

#### Q6. Common gateway interface is used to? [R]

- [ ] Generate web pages
- [x] Generate executable files from web content by web server
- [ ] Stream videos
- [ ] All

**Explanation:**
The Common Gateway Interface (CGI) is a standard protocol that allows web servers to interact with executable files on a web server. This means that CGI is used to generate executable files from web content by the web server. CGI scripts can be written in various programming languages such as Perl, Python, or C++, and they are used to process user input, generate dynamic web content, and perform other server-side tasks.

#### Q7. Computer which stores the different web pages is called as: [U]

- [ ] Service Provider
- [ ] Web Browser
- [ ] Web Crawler
- [x] Web Server

**Explanation:**
A computer that stores different web pages is called a web server. A web server is responsible for hosting websites and delivering web pages to users when they request them. It receives requests from web browsers, retrieves the requested web pages from its storage, and sends them back to the user's browser for display. This is how websites are made accessible to users over the internet.

#### Q8. A __________ is the simplest form of a website, in which the site’s content is delivered without the use of server-side processing. [U]

- [ ] E-Commerce Website
- [ ] Dynamic Websites
- [ ] Social Networking Websites
- [x] Static website

**Explanation:**
A static website is the simplest form of a website where the content is delivered without the use of server-side processing. This means that the web pages are pre-designed and do not change based on user interactions or inputs. Static websites are mainly used to provide information or showcase products/services without any complex functionality. Unlike dynamic websites that use server-side processing to generate content on the fly, static websites are easier to develop and maintain as they do not require any server-side scripting or database integration.

#### Q9. DNS is an Internet service that translates domain names to or from: [R]

- [ ] MAC address
- [x] IP address
- [ ] Both
- [ ] None

**Explanation:**
DNS (Domain Name System) is an Internet service that translates domain names to IP addresses. When a user enters a domain name in their web browser, the DNS server is responsible for converting that domain name into the corresponding IP address of the server hosting the website. This IP address is then used to establish a connection and retrieve the requested web page. Therefore, the correct answer is IP address.

#### Q10. Which protocol is used for secure communication over the internet? [R]

- [ ] IP
- [ ] UDP
- [ ] HTTP
- [x] HTTPS

**Explanation:**
HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure) is the correct answer because it is a protocol that provides secure communication over the internet. It combines the HTTP protocol with SSL/TLS encryption to ensure that data transmitted between a web server and a browser remains secure and cannot be easily intercepted or tampered with by unauthorized individuals. This is particularly important for sensitive information such as passwords, credit card details, and personal data.

#### Q11. Which protocol helps to transfer files between computers? [R]

- [x] FTP
- [ ] HTTP
- [ ] UDP
- [ ] FTTP

**Explanation:**
FTP (File Transfer Protocol) is the correct answer because it is specifically designed to transfer files between computers over a network. FTP allows users to upload, download, and manage files on a remote server. It provides a reliable and efficient method for transferring files, making it a commonly used protocol for file sharing and remote file management. HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is primarily used for transferring web pages and data, UDP (User Datagram Protocol) is a connectionless protocol used for fast transmission of data, and FTTP (Fiber to the Premises) is a broadband network architecture.

#### Q12. Which of these is a client-server application? [U]

- [ ] Web browsing
- [ ] E-MAIL
- [x] Both
- [ ] None

**Explanation:**
Both web browsing and email are examples of client-server applications. In web browsing, the user's web browser acts as the client, sending requests to web servers and receiving responses. In email, the user's email client (such as Outlook or Gmail) acts as the client, connecting to an email server to send and receive messages. In both cases, there is a client (user's device) that interacts with a server (web server or email server) to access and exchange data.

#### Q13. Assume that an HTML form is designed to purchase the furniture. All the items required are being checked. After selecting the items the payment details are entered and the submit button is pressed. From the following options which one would you prefer to send the data to the server. Assume that all the security is handled. [U]

- [ ] Only POST
- [ ] Only GET
- [x] Either of GET or POST
- [ ] Neither GET nor POST

**Explanation:**
When designing an HTML form to purchase furniture, it is preferable to send the data to the server using either the GET or POST method. Both methods can be used to send data securely, and the choice between them depends on the specific requirements of the form. The GET method appends the form data to the URL, making it visible in the browser's address bar and potentially bookmarkable. On the other hand, the POST method sends the form data in the body of the HTTP request, making it more secure and suitable for sensitive information like payment details. Therefore, either of GET or POST can be used based on the specific needs of the form.

#### Q14. Which of the following statements are true? [R]

- [ ] HTTP runs over TCP
- [ ] HTTP allows information to be stored in a URL
- [x] Both
- [ ] None

**Explanation:**
Both statements are true. HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) runs over TCP (Transmission Control Protocol), which is a reliable transport protocol. This means that HTTP uses TCP to establish a connection, ensure data integrity, and provide reliable delivery of information. Additionally, HTTP allows information to be stored in a URL (Uniform Resource Locator). This is commonly seen in query strings, where data is appended to the end of a URL to pass parameters or additional information to a web server.

#### Q15. The ______ method requests data from a specified source. [R]

- [x] GET
- [ ] POST
- [ ] Both
- [ ] None

**Explanation:**
The GET method is used to request data from a specified source. It is commonly used to retrieve information from a server or a website. Unlike the POST method which is used to send data to the server, the GET method is used for retrieving data. This can include retrieving web pages, images, documents, or any other type of data that is available on the specified source.

#### Q16. What does TCP stand for? [R]

- [ ] Transport Client Port
- [ ] Transmission Client Port
- [ ] Telnet Control Port
- [x] Transmission Control Protocol

**Explanation:**
TCP stands for Transmission Control Protocol. It is a standard protocol used for transmitting data over networks. TCP ensures reliable and ordered delivery of data packets between devices on a network. It breaks down large data files into smaller packets, sends them across the network, and then reassembles them at the receiving end. TCP also includes error-checking mechanisms to ensure data integrity and flow control to manage the rate of data transmission. Overall, TCP is a fundamental protocol in the internet protocol suite and is widely used for various applications such as web browsing, email, file transfer, and more.

#### Q17. What is a PORT? [R]

- [ ] A collection of protocol layers
- [x] An address for a software process
- [ ] A protocol stack for TCP/IP
- [ ] A software process that provides a service requested by a client

**Explanation:**
A port is an address for a software process. In computer networking, a port is a communication endpoint that is used by software to identify a specific process or service on a device. It allows multiple processes or services to run on the same device without conflicts. Each port is assigned a unique number, known as a port number, which helps in routing the data packets to the correct destination. By using port numbers, the communication between different software processes is facilitated, allowing them to send and receive data over a network.

#### Q18. What is a socket? [R]

- [x] A combination of a host IP address and a port number
- [ ] A collection of protocol layers
- [ ] Provides a service requested by a client
- [ ] A set agreed signals

**Explanation:**
A socket is a combination of a host IP address and a port number. This combination allows for communication between two devices over a network. The IP address identifies the specific device, while the port number identifies the specific application or service running on that device. By using sockets, data can be sent and received between the client and server applications,

#### Q19. Which of the following does not describe the IP packet delivery layer? [U]

- [ ] Connectionless
- [ ] Best Effort
- [ ] Unreliable
- [x] Streaming

**Explanation:**
The IP packet delivery layer is responsible for delivering packets from the source to the destination. It operates in a connectionless manner, meaning that there is no established connection between the sender and receiver. It also follows a best effort approach, where it tries its best to deliver packets but does not guarantee delivery or quality of service. Additionally, it is considered unreliable as it does not provide mechanisms for error detection or correction. However, the term "streaming" does not describe the IP packet delivery layer as it refers to a specific method of transmitting continuous data in real-time.

#### Q20. Which of the following techniques will allow hosts on a private Intranet with private addresses to communicate with the Internet? [R]

- [ ] CIDR blocks
- [ ] Route Summarization
- [ ] BGP
- [x] NAT (Network Address Translation)

**Explanation:**
NAT (Network Address Translation) allows hosts on a private Intranet with private addresses to communicate with the Internet. NAT translates the private IP addresses of the internal network into a single public IP address when communicating with the Internet. This allows multiple devices on the private network to share a single public IP address, extending the limited number of available public IP addresses and enabling communication with the Internet.
